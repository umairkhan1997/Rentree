Logo on app icon to be fixed to be full with no white in background 
Logo on app load up to be clearer and correct size as it’s too stretched 
People who upload jobs don’t need to log in. 
Tab and layout not very good. Also would need a message tab and change peoples tab to home or something. 
Would prefer post your on job on the same page as the logon start up page 
Still need bugdet sheet for people to hire
Still need photo page 
Gps map for people to add job address 
How do people attach a quote to someone’s job 
The links for kitchens,bathrooms,living rooms,pools etc for people to upload there modern or newly done pics similar to The Houzz app as discussed 
Colours on app would prefer to be the company colours which is same as logo ( black and green )

Also I would like access to see members and jobs etc so I can delete them if not appropriate. But only on my end don’t want the public to be able to delete

Also I’d like to be able to ad more trades in the categories
